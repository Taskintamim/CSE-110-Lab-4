Java Lab Manual – Static, Final & Arrays

This repository contains 10 lab exercises focusing on static variables, static methods, static blocks, final variables, and basic array operations in Java.

Lab Exercise 1: Static Variable (Object Counter)

Count how many objects are created using a static variable.

Sample Output:

Total objects created: 3

Lab Exercise 2: Static Method

Create a static method square(int x) and call it using the class name.

Sample Output:

Square of 7 = 49

Lab Exercise 3: Static Initialization Block

Initialize static variables inside a static block and print a message.

Sample Output:

Static block executed.
Version: 2
Loaded: true

Lab Exercise 4: final Variable

Declare a final int MAX_VALUE and print it.

Sample Output:

MAX_VALUE = 100

Lab Exercise 5: final Parameter

Create display(final int x) and print its value.

Sample Output:

Value: 50

Lab Exercise 6: final Local Variable

Use a final local variable inside a method.

Sample Output:

n = 10

Lab Exercise 7: Array length Variable

Create an integer array and print its length.

Sample Output:

Array length = 5

Lab Exercise 8: Sum of Array Elements

Use a loop and array.length to calculate the sum.

Sample Output:

Sum = 45

Lab Exercise 9: Static Stack Implementation

Implement a simple stack using:

Array

tos

push() and pop() methods

Sample Output:

Popped: 30
Popped: 20

Lab Exercise 10: Static Utility Class (ArrayTools)

Create static methods:

max(int[])

min(int[])

Sample Output:

Max = 27
Min = 3
