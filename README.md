Java Lab Exercises – Static, Final & Arrays
Lab 1: Static Variable (Object Counter)
Count how many objects are created using a static variable inside a class.
Output: Total objects created: 3
Lab 2: Static Method
Create a class with static int square(int x) and call it using the class name.
Output: Square of 7 = 49
Lab 3: Static Initialization Block
Use a static block to initialize static variables and print a message.
Output:
Static block executed.
Version: 2
Loaded: true

Lab 4: final Variable
Use a final int MAX_VALUE and print it.
Output: MAX_VALUE = 100
Lab 5: final Parameter
Create display(final int x) and print x.
Output: Value: 50
Lab 6: final Local Variable
Declare a final local variable and observe that reassignment is not allowed.
Output: n = 10
Lab 7: Array length
Create an integer array and print its length.
Output: Array length = 5
Lab 8: Sum of Array Elements
Use a loop and array length to calculate the sum.
Output: Sum = 45
Lab 9: Static Stack
Implement stack using an array, tos, push(), and pop().
Output:
Popped: 30
Popped: 20

Lab 10: Static Array Tools
Create static methods max(int[]) and min(int[]).
Output:
Max = 27
Min = 3


If you want, I can also generate the Java code files for all exercises.
